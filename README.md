# Feed Reader Testing

This is a implementation of testing using [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/) for the Feed Reader Testing project of Udacity's Frontend Nanodegree.

## Running the project

`git clone https://github.com/ls895/frontend-nanodegree-feedreader.git`

Then go to the project directory and open `index.html` locally on the browser.

In `index.html`, the sample application is displayed on the upper half and the Jasmine testing result displays on the lower half of the page.

There are 7 tests covered by this implementation and they should all display green on `index.html`.

## Files

`js/app.js` contains the underlying logic for the sample application.

`jasmine/spec/feedreader.js` contains the custom Jasmine testing code. Detailed explanation of the testing logic is provided by comments inside this file.
